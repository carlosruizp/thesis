\subsection{Inductive Bias Learning Problem} % Baxter
% The first theoretical work on MTL... MTL as a Bias Learning Problem
Tipically in Machine Learning the goal is to find the best hypothesis $\hyp{x}{\param_0}$ from a space of hypothesis $\hypspace = \set{\hyp{x}{\param}, \param \in \paramspace}$, where $\paramspace$ is any set of parameters. This best candidate can be selected according to different inductive principles, which define a method of approximating a global function $f(x)$ from a training set:
$ \sample \defeq \set{(x_i, y_i),\; \idotsn} $
where $(x_i, y_i)$ are sampled from a distribution $\distf$.
%
In the classical statistics we find the Maximum Likelihood approach, where the goal is to estimate the density $\fun{x} = \cond{y}{x}$ and the hypothesis space is parametric, i.e. $\hypspace = \set{\hyp{x}{\param}, \param \in \paramspace \subset \reals^m}$. The learner select the parameter $\param$ that maximizes the probability of the data given the hypothesis.
%
Another more direct inductive principle is Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM), which is the most common one. In ERM the densities are ignored and an empirical error $\emprisk$ is minimized with the hope of minimizing the true expected error $\exprisk$, which would result in a good generalization. 
%
Several models use the ERM principle to generalize from data such as Neural Networks or Support Vector Machines. These methods are designed to find a good hypothesis $\hyp{x}{\alpha}$ from a given space $\hypspace$. The definition of such space $\hypspace$ define the bias for these problems. If $\mathcal{H}$ does not contain any good hypothesis, the learner will not be able to learn.
%

The best hypothesis space we can provide is the one containing only the optimal hypothesis, but this is the original problem that we want to solve. Therefore, in the single task scenario, there is no difference between bias learning and ordinary learning.
Instead, we focus on the situation where we want to solve multiple related tasks. In that case, we can obtain a good space $\hypspace$ that contains good solutions for the different tasks.
%
In~\cite{baxter2000model} an effort is made to define the concepts needed to construct the theory about inductive bias learning, which can be seen as a generalization of strict multi-task learning. This is done by defining an environment of tasks and extending the work of~\cite{vapnik2013nature}, which defines the capacity of space of hypothesis, Baxter defines the capacity of a family of spaces of hypothesis.

% Review of concepts for STL in Supervised Learning
Before presenting the concepts defined for Bias Learning, and to establish an analogy to those of ordinary learning, we briefly review some statistical learning concepts.
\subsubsection*{Ordinary Learning}
In the ordinary statistical learning, some theoretical concepts are used:
\begin{itemize}
    \item an \emph{input space} $\Xspace$ and an \emph{output space} $\Yspace$,
    \item a \emph{probability distribution} $\distf$, which is unknown, defined over $\Xspace \times \Yspace$,
    \item a \emph{loss function} $\loss{\cdot}{\cdot}:\Yspace \times \Yspace \to \reals$, and
    \item a \emph{hypothesis space} $\hypspace = \set{\hyp{x}{\param}, \param \in \paramspace \subset \reals^m}$ with hypothesis $\hyp{\cdot}{\param}: \Xspace \to \Yspace$.
\end{itemize}
The goal for the learner is to select a hypothesis $\hyp{x}{\alpha} \in \mathcal{H}$, or equivalently $\param \in \paramspace$, that minimizes the expected risk
$$ \exprisk(\param) =  \int_{\Xspace \times \Yspace} \loss{\hyp{x}{\alpha}}{y} d\distf(x, y) .$$
The distribution $\distf$ is unknown, but we have a training set $\sample = \{(x_1, y_1), \ldots, (x_\nsamples, y_\nsamples)\}$ of samples drawn from $\distf$. 
The approach is then is to apply the ERM inductive principle, that is to minimize the empirical risk
$$ \emprisk(\param) = \frac{1}{\nsamples} \sum_{i=1}^\nsamples l(h(x_i), y_i).$$
Thus, a learner $\mathcal{A}$ maps the set of training samples to a set of hypothesis:
\begin{equation}
    \nonumber
    \mathcal{A} : \bigcup {(\Xspace \times \Yspace)^\nsamples} \to \hypspace.
\end{equation}
Although $\emprisk(\param)$ is an unbiased estimator of $\exprisk(\param)$, it has been shown~\cite{vapnik2013nature} that this approach, despite being the most evident one, is not the best principle that can be followed.
This has relation with two facts: the first one is that the unbiased property is an asymptotical one, the second one has to do with overfitting.
Vapnik answers to the question of what can be said about $\exprisk$ when $\param$ minimizes $\emprisk(\param)$, and moreover, his results are valid also for small number of training samples $n$.
More specifically, Vapnik sets the sufficient and necessary conditions for the consistency of an inductive learning process, i.e. for $\emprisk(\param) \toprob \exprisk(\param) $ uniformly. Vapnik also defines the capacity of a hypothesis space and use it to derive bounds on the rate of this convergence for any $\param \in \paramspace$ and, more importantly, bounds on the difference $\inf_{\param \in \paramspace} \emprisk(\param) - \inf_{\param \in \paramspace} \exprisk(\param)$.
Under some general conditions, he proves that
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ordinary_generalization_bound}
    \inf_{\param \in \paramspace} \emprisk(\param) - \inf_{\param \in \paramspace} \exprisk(\param) \leq B(\nsamples/\vcdim)
\end{equation}
where $B$ is some non-decreasing function and $\vcdim$ is the capacity of the space $\hypspace$, also named the VC-dimension $\hypspace$. This means that the generalization ability of a learning process can be controlled in terms of two factors:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The number of training samples $\nsamples$. A greater number of training samples assures a better generalization of the learning process.This looks intuitive and could be already inferred from the asymptotical properties. 
    \item The VC-dimension $\vcdim$, or capacity, of the hypothesis space $\hypspace$, which is desirable to be small. This term is not intuitive and is the most important term in Vapnik theory.
\end{itemize}
The VC-dimension measures the capacity of a set of hypothesis $\hypspace$. 
%In the case of a set of indicator functions, it is the maximum number of vectors $x_1, \ldots, x_\vcdim$ that can be shattered (in two classes) by functions of this set. In the case of real functions, it is defined as the VC-dimension of the following set of indicator functions $ I(x, \alpha, \beta) = \bm{1}_{\{\hyp{x}{\param} - \beta\}} $.
If the capacity of the set $\hypspace$ is too large, we may find a
hypothesis $\hyp{x}{\opt{\param}}$ that minimizes $\emprisk$ but does not 
generalize well and therefore, does not minimize $\exprisk$. This is the 
overfitting problem. 
On the other side, if we use a simple $\hypspace$, 
with low capacity, we could be in a situation where there is not a good hypothesis $\hyp{x}{\alpha} \in \hypspace$, so the empirical risk $\inf_{\param \in \paramspace} \exprisk$ is too large. This is the underfitting problem.

% The Structural Risk Minimization (SRM) as an inductive principle, proposed by Vapnik (as opposed to the ERM), tries to find a tradeoff between minimizing $\emprisk$ and minimizing $\vcdim$. The idea is to define an admissible structure, that is a sequence of hypothesis spaces:
% $$ \mathcal{H}_1 \subset \mathcal{H}_2 \subset \ldots \subset \mathcal{H}_k \subset \ldots $$ 
% where their VC-dimensions are ordered:
% $$ d_1 < d_2 < \ldots < d_k < \ldots$$
% where $d_i$ is the VC-dimension of $\mathcal{H}_i$.
% SRM selects the hypothesis $\hyp{x}{\alpha^*} = \hyp{x}{\alpha_i^*} \in \hypspace_i$ that obtains the best bound for the actual risk $\exprisk$.
% This admissible structure can be built in various ways. In Neural Networks in can be the built by increasing the number of hidden layers. In other methods, such as SVM or Ridge Regression, this is done by decreasing the regularization.
% However, this SRM principle is usually replaced by a cross-validation (CV) procedure.

% Support Vector Machines, which are the most representative models of this theory, use the VC-dimension also in other way (apart from the SRM principle or the CV procedure). The goal of finding the optimal hyperplane, that is, that with the maximum margin between the classes, has its motivation in the fact the set of such type of hypothesis have a lower VC-dimension that the set of all hyperplanes do.


% Extension to MTL
\subsubsection*{Bias Learning: Concept and Components}
In ~\cite{baxter2000model} two main concepts are presented: the \emph{family of hypothesis spaces} and an \emph{environment} of related tasks. 
For simplicity we consider $\hypf(x) = \hypf(x, \param)$, that is $\param$ completely defines $\hypf$, we also substitute $\param$ by $\hypf$ for an easier formulation when necessary.
Using these concepts, the bias learning problem has the following components:
\begin{itemize}
    \item an \emph{input space} $\Xspace$ and an \emph{output space} $\Yspace$,
    \item an \emph{environment} $(\bprobspace, \bdistf)$ where $\bprobspace$ is a set of distributions $P$ defined over $\Xspace \times \Yspace$, and we can sample from $\bprobspace$ according to a distribution $\bdistf$,
    \item a \emph{loss function} $\loss{\cdot}{\cdot}:\Yspace \times \Yspace \to \reals$, and
    \item a \emph{family of hypothesis spaces} $\hypspacef = \set{\hypspace_\delta, \delta \in \Delta}$, where each element $\hypspace_\delta$ is a set of hypothesis.
\end{itemize}
Analogous to ordinary learning, the goal is to minimize the expected risk, defined as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:biaslearn_exprisk}
    \bexprisk(\delta) = \int_{\bprobspace} \inf_{\hypf \in \hypspace_\delta} \risk_P(\hypf) d\bdistf(P) = \int_{\bprobspace} \inf_{\hypf \in \hypspace_\delta} \int_{\Xspace \times Y} l(h(x), y) dP(x, y) d\bdistf(P).
\end{equation}
Again, we do not know $\bprobspace$ nor $\bdistf$, but we have a training set samples from the environment $(\bprobspace, \bdistf)$ obtained in the following way:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Sample $T$ times from $\bdistf$ obtaining $P_1, \ldots, P_T \in \bprobspace$
    \item For $r=1, \ldots, T$ sample $m$ pairs $z_r = \{(x_1^r, y_1^r), \ldots, (x_m^r, y_m^r)\}$ according to $P_r$ where $(x_i^r, y_i^r) \in X \times Y$ .
\end{enumerate}
We obtain a sample $z=\{(x_i^r, y_i^r), r=1,\; i=1, \ldots, \;m=1, \ldots, T\}$, with $\npertask$ examples from $\ntasks$ different learning tasks, and
\begin{equation}
    \nonumber
    \bsample \defeq 
    \begin{pmatrix}
        (x_1^1, y_1^1) & \ldots & (x_m^1, y_m^1) \\
        \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
        (x_1^\ntasks, y_1^\ntasks) & \ldots & (x_m^\ntasks, y_m^\ntasks) \\
    \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
is named as a $(\ntasks, \npertask)$-sample.
Using $\bsample$ we can define the empirical loss as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:biaslearn_emprisk}
    \bemprisk(\delta) = \sum_{r=1}^\ntasks \inf_{\hypf \in \hypspace_\delta} \hat{\risk}_{\sample_r}(\hypf) = \sum_{r=1}^\ntasks \inf_{\hypf \in \hypspace_\delta} \sum_{i=1}^m l(\hypf(x_i^r), y_i^r),
\end{equation}
which is an average of the empirical losses of each task. 
Note, however, that in the case of the bias learner, this estimate is biased, since $\risk_{P_r}(\hypf)$ does not coincide with $\hat{\risk}_{z_r}(\hypf)$. 
Putting all together, a bias learner $\mathcal{A}$ maps the set of all $(\ntasks, \npertask)$-samples to a family of hypothesis spaces:
\begin{equation}
    \nonumber
    \mathcal{A} : \bigcup {(\Xspace \times \Yspace)^{(\ntasks, \npertask)}} \to \hypspacef.
\end{equation}
%

To follow an analogous path to that of ordinary learning, the milestones in bias learning theory should include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Checking the consistency of the Bias Learning methods, i.e. proving that $\bemprisk(\delta)$ converges uniformly in probability to $\bexprisk(\delta)$.
    \item Defining a notion of capacity of hypothesis space families $\hypspacef$.
    \item Finding a bound of $\bemprisk(\delta) - \bexprisk(\delta)$ for any $\delta$ using the capacity of the hypothesis space family. If possible, finding also a bound for $\inf_{\delta \in \Delta}\bemprisk(\delta) - \inf_{\delta \in \Delta} \bexprisk(\delta)$.
\end{itemize}
To achieve these goals some previous definitions are needed.
%
\subsubsection*{Bias Learning Capacities}
% Pseudo-metrics, Covering numbers and Capacities
In first place, a \emph{sample-driven} pseudo-metric of $(\ntasks, 1)$-empirical risks is defined.
Consider a sequence of $\ntasks$ probabilities $\bprobseq = (P_1, \ldots, P_\ntasks)$ sampled from $\bprobspace$ according the the distribution $\bdistf$. 
Consider also the set of sequences of $\ntasks$ hypothesis 
$\hypspace^\ntasks \defeq \set{ \bm{\hypf} = (\hypf_1, \ldots, \hypf_\ntasks) , \hypf_1, \ldots, \hypf_\ntasks \in \hypspace} .$ 
We can define then the set of $(\ntasks, 1)$-empirical risks as 
$$\hypspace^\ntasks_\lossf \defeq \set{ \bm{\hypf}_\lossf(x_1, y_1, \ldots, x_\ntasks, y_\ntasks) = \sum_{r=1}^\ntasks \lossf(\hypf(x_i), y_i) , \hypf_1, \ldots, \hypf_\ntasks \in \hypspace} $$
The family of the set of $\ntasks$-risks of hypothesis is then $\bsetsample = \bigcup_{\hypspace \in \hypspacef} \hypspace^\ntasks$. Now we can define
\begin{equation}
    \nonumber
    \begin{aligned}
        \dist{\bprobseq}(\bm{\hypf}_\lossf, \bm{\hypf'}_\lossf) = \int_{(\Xspace \times \Yspace)^{\ntasks}} &\abs{\bm{\hypf}_\lossf(x_1, y_1, \ldots, x_\ntasks, y_\ntasks) - \bm{\hypf'}_\lossf(x_1, y_1, \ldots, x_\ntasks, y_\ntasks)} \\ 
        & d{P_1}(x_1, y_1) \ldots d{P_\ntasks}(x_\ntasks, y_\ntasks)
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
for $\bm{\hypf}_\lossf, \bm{\hypf'}_\lossf \in \hypspace_\lossf, \hypspace'_\lossf$ as a pseudo-metric in $\hypspacef^T$.
%

Then, a \emph{distribution-driven} pseudo-metric is defined. Given a distribution $P$ on $\Xspace \times \Yspace$. Consider the set of infimum expected risk for each $\hypspace$:
\begin{equation}
    \nonumber
    \hypspace^* \defeq \inf_{\hypf \in \hypspace} \risk_P(\hypf).
\end{equation}
The family of such sets is defined as 
$\bsetdist = \set{\hypspace^*, \hypspace \in \hypspacef}$.
The pseudo-metric in this space is given by $Q$:
\begin{equation}
    \nonumber
    \dist{\bdistf} = \int_\bprobspace \abs{\hypspace_1^* - \hypspace_2^*} d\bdistf
\end{equation}
With these two pseudo-metrics, two capacities for families of hypothesis spaces are defined. For that the definition of $\epsilon$-cover is needed. Given a pseudo-metric $\dist{S}$ in a space $\mathcal{S}$, 
a set of $l$ elements $s_1, \ldots, s_l \in \mathcal{S}$ is an $\epsilon$-cover of $\mathcal{S}$ if 
$ \dist{S}(s, s_i) \leq \epsilon $
for some $i=1, \ldots, l$.  Let $\mathcal{N}(\epsilon, \mathcal{S}, \dist{S})$ denote the size of the smallest $\epsilon$-cover.
Then, we can define the following capacities of a family space $\hypspacef$:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The \emph{sample-driven capacity} $\capacity{\epsilon}{\bsetsample} \defeq \sup_{\bprobseq} \mathcal{N}(\epsilon, \hypspacef^T, \dist{\bprobseq})$.
    \item The \emph{distribution-driven capacity} $\capacity{\epsilon}{\bsetdist} \defeq \sup_Q \mathcal{N}(\epsilon, \bsetdist, \dist{\bdistf})$.
\end{itemize}

% Uniform Convergence for bias learners (Comparison with Vapnik)
Using these capacities, the convergence (uniformly over all $\hypspace \in \hypspacef$) of bias learners can be proved~\cite[Theorem~2]{baxter2000model}. Moreover, the bias expected risk is bounded
\begin{equation}
    \nonumber
    \bexprisk(\hypspace) \leq \bemprisk(\hypspace) + \epsilon
\end{equation}
with probability $1 - \delta$, given sufficiently large $\ntasks$ and $\npertask$, 
\begin{equation}
    \nonumber
    \ntasks \geq \bigO {\frac{1}{\epsilon^2} \log\frac{\capacity{\frac{\epsilon}{32}}{\bsetdist}}{\delta} } , \; \npertask \geq \bigO{\frac{1}{\ntasks \epsilon^2}  \log\frac{\capacity{\frac{\epsilon}{32}}{\bsetsample}}{\delta} } .
\end{equation}
It should be noted that the bound for $\npertask$ is inversely proportional to $\ntasks$, that is, the more tasks we have, the less samples we need for each task. 
As with $\hypf(x)$ and $\param$, since any $\hypspace$ is defined by a $\delta \in \Delta$, we omit $\delta$ and write just $\hypspace$ for simplicity.

% Multi-Task Learning (strictly speaking, with fixed tasks)
\subsubsection*{Multi-Task Learning}
The previous result is a result for pure Bias Learning, where we have an $(\bsetdist, \bdistf)$-environment of tasks. In Multi-Task Learning, we have a fixed number of tasks $\ntasks$. The goal is not learning a hypothesis space $\hypspace$ but a sequence of hypothesis $\bm{\hypf} = (\hypf_1, \ldots, \hypf_\ntasks), \hypf_1, \ldots, \hypf_\ntasks \in \hypspace $.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:mtlearn_exprisk}
    \bexprisk(\bm{\hypf}) = \sum_{r=1}^\ntasks \risk_{P_r}(\hypf_r)  = \sum_{r=1}^\ntasks \int_{\Xspace \times Y} l(\hypf_r(x), y) d{P_r}(x, y),
\end{equation}
and the empirical risk is defined as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:mtlearn_emprisk}
    \bemprisk(\bm{\hypf}) = \sum_{r=1}^\ntasks \hat{\risk}_{\sample_r}(\hypf_r) = \sum_{r=1}^\ntasks \sum_{i=1}^m l(\hypf_r(x_i^r), y_i^r).
\end{equation}
A similar result to that of Bias Learning is given for Multi-Task Learning~\cite[Theorem~4]{baxter2000model}:
\begin{equation}
    \nonumber
    \bexprisk(\bm{\hypf}) \leq \bemprisk(\bm{\hypf}) + \epsilon,
\end{equation}
with probability $1 - \delta$ given that the number of samples per task
\begin{equation}
    \nonumber
    \npertask \geq \bigO{\frac{1}{\ntasks \epsilon^2} \log\frac{\capacity{\frac{\epsilon}{16}}{\bsetsample}}{\delta}}.
\end{equation}

% Feature Learning
\subsubsection*{Feature Learning}
Feature Learning is a common way to encode bias. The most popular example are Neural Networks, where all the hidden layers can be seen as a Feature Learning engine that learns a mapping from the original space to a space with ''strong'' features.
In general, a set of ''strong'' feature maps $\Phi = \set{\phi, \phi: \Xspace \to \Fspace}$ .



\pagebreak


In first place, he defines some concepts that allow to write two concepts of capacity related to $\mathbb{H}$. Using these two concepts, he shows uniform convergence of $e_Q(\hypspace)$ to $\hat{e}_z(h)$. Moreover, this result is valid not only asymptotically:
\begin{equation*}
    e_Q(\hypspace) \leq \hat{e}_z(\hypspace) + \epsilon
\end{equation*}
with $m$ such that
\begin{equation*}
    m \geq \frac{1}{T \epsilon^2} C(\mathbb{H})
\end{equation*}
where $C(\mathbb{H})$ is a notion of capacity of $\mathbb{H}$ (this bound is very simplified in this work). We can observe that as the number of tasks grow, we need less examples in each task. Also, if we have related tasks (and then $\mathbb{H}$ can have low capacity) the number of necessary examples per task also decreases.
However, this bound is not so useful because it is theoretical, that is, we have theoretical notions of the capacity of $\mathbb{H}$ but we cannot compute it.

He then focuses on feature learning, that is, we define a specific type of learners where we have two steps:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Learning the space of features (or learning $\hypspace_f$)
    \item Learning the best linear model $g$ over the features given by $f$ (or learning the best hypothesis $g \circ f$ in $\hypspace_f$)
\end{itemize}
For these type of models, he also shows how a multi-output Neural Network (which can be seen an MTL NN) is a model that embodies this feature learning approach.
The NN can be seen as a linear model $g$ over a transformation $f$ of the original data. That is, the set of functions $\hypspace_f = \{g \circ f \}$ used by the neural network is learned trying to minimize the empirical loss when we update $f$.
Baxter derives specific bound for the NN using that the capacity of the hypothesis space family $\mathbb{H}$ can be computed for this case.

Finally, he show some results for Multi-Task Learning. 
Multi-Task Learning is a particular case of Bias Learning where we are not interested in finding an optimal hypothesis space $\hypspace$ where we can find good solutions for a great variety of problems, but our goal is to find good solutions for a fixed number of tasks. That is, instead of having a family of probabilities $\mathcal{P}$ with a probability measure $\mathcal{Q}$, we have a fixed vector $\bm{P} = (P_1, \ldots, P_T)$ of probability measures over a fixed set of tasks and the learner minimizes:
\begin{equation}
    e_{\bm{P}}(\hypspace) = \sum_{r=1}^\ntasks e_{P_r}(h_r)  = \sum_{r=1}^\ntasks \int_{X \times Y} l(h_r(x), y) d P_r(x, y) .
\end{equation}
Then, we define the empirical multi-task error as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:mtllearn_exprisk}
    \hat{e}_z(\hypspace) = \sum_{r=1}^\ntasks \hat{e}_{z_r}(h_r) = \sum_{r=1}^\ntasks \sum_{i=1}^m l(h_r(x_i^r), y_i^r).
\end{equation}
The difference is subtle but we have a different objective. In the multi-task setting, the hypothesis space $\hypspace$ found will not necessarily be good for generalizing to new tasks. Also, we have got rid of the $\inf$ term, which was difficult to deal with.
%

Restricting to the Boolean functions, Baxter defines an extension of the VC-dimension $d_\mathbb{H}(T)$ that can be computed (for these Boolean map functions). Using that, he extends the previous theorems obtaining ``computable'' bounds and he derives a lower bound for $m$, if $m$ is below that lower bound then we can find tasks such that the error made by our estimator is larger then certain $\epsilon$.
