Dr. Daniel Hernández-Lobato obtained a Ph.D. and a M.Phil. in Computer Science from Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Spain, in January 2010 and June 2007, respectively. His Ph.D. thesis received the award to the best thesis on Computer Science defended during that academic year in that institution. Between November 2009 and September 2011 he worked as a post-doc researcher at Université catholique de Louvain, Belgium. There he had the opportunity to collaborate with Prof. Pierre Dupont and Prof. Bernard Lauwerys in the identification of biomakers for the early diagnosis of arthritis. In September 2011, he moved back to Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, and since January 2014 he works there as a Lecturer of Computer Science. His research interests are mainly focused on the Bayesian approach to machine learning, including topics such as Bayesian optimization, kernel methods and Gaussian processes, and approximate Bayesian inference.
