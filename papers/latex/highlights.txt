Predictive entropy search is applied to the constrained multi-objective scenario.
The technique reduces the entropy of the Pareto set in the feasible space.
The acquisition function is approximated using expectation propagation.
Empirical results show that the proposed technique outperforms other methods.
The proposed technique allows for decoupled evaluation scenarios.
